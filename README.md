# Skystone_Scoring_App

This is a scoring app done for the Pioneer Robotics Team participating in the First Tech Challenge.

Please be kind, this is a project done by a student out of his own time for his team. The main
funciton of the app is to allow for the "Scouters," those responsible for collecting data on other
teams, to have a convenient and reliable method to accurately score and rank the other teams as
well as our own team. 

If you have any improvements you want to make, please always do so on another branch and not on the
main branch, all help is appreciated. Thank you
